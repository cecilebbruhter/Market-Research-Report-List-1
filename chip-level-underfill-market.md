<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chip Level Underfill Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Filler</li><li>Non Flowing Filler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chip level underfill market is primarily divided into two types: fluid fillers and non-flowing fillers. Fluid fillers are resin-based materials that flow into the gaps between chips and substrates, providing excellent moisture and thermal resistance. They ensure reliable bonding and protection against mechanical stresses. Non-flowing fillers, on the other hand, are typically paste-like and do not spread significantly after application. They offer ease of handling and precise placement, making them suitable for specific applications where controlled filling is essential.</p></p>
