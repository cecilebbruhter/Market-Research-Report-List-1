<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Plastics in Automotive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Type</li><li>Thermoplastics Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Engineering plastics in the automotive market are categorized into two main types: thermosetting and thermoplastics. Thermosetting plastics, once cured, retain their shape and resist deformation, making them ideal for components requiring high stability and heat resistance, like engine parts. In contrast, thermoplastics can be reshaped upon heating, allowing for flexibility in design and easy processing. They are commonly used in various applications, including interior panels and exterior trims, due to their lightweight properties and excellent impact resistance.</p></p>
