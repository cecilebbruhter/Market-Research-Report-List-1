<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rail Vehicle Sanitation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Toilet System</li><li>Pressured Water Flushing Toilet System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rail vehicle sanitation system market comprises primarily two types: the vacuum toilet system and the pressured water flushing toilet system. The vacuum toilet system efficiently uses suction to manage waste, requiring less water and reducing the weight of waste tanks, making it ideal for high-speed trains. In contrast, the pressured water flushing toilet system uses pressurized water to flush waste, providing a more traditional flushing experience. Both systems aim to enhance passenger comfort and hygiene while addressing waste management needs in rail vehicles.</p></p>
